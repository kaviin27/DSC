I&#039;ve tried many different SS/SNRIs over the past 12 years &amp; they all made me have extreme suicidal thoughts. I had kind of given up hope on finding something that worked for me, but then a new psychiatrist recommended trying Wellbutrin. The first week or so was rough, I had blurry vision, shakes, &amp; extreme light sensitivity. Those negative side effects went away after 3 weeks. I&#039;m 3 months in &amp; my mood has significantly increased, which is just amazing because my depression worsens significantly in the winter.

But then I learned since I take the 300 and 150 that there was a new formulation on the market called Forfivo XL 450 and I take that once a day in the morning along with some Lamictal 100mg and I feel GREAT.

The narcotics lifted my mood and the Cymbalta did help with all other pain. Eventually the narcotic I was on (lortab) stopped working all together. I&#039;m not a big fan of opiates for pain relief and would not have taken them had it not been my only choice to feel normal. (I couldnt even sit in my car for more than 15 mins without searing nerve pain).I accidently stumbled on a review that said Wellbutrin also helped with back pain. It has been the best thing that&#039;s happened to me. It has replaced both meds and I feel great!

I have been depressed for about 5 years. During my college years it got really bad up to a point I started seeking help. First it was the college counselor, then a private counselor, then finally a psychiatrist. I was struggling in school, failing a bunch of classes because I had a terrible time focusing and remembering things. I was sleeping 10  hours a day, something I thought was impossible for a college student and still somehow managed to nap in the afternoons. Since I got on Wellbutrin I have a huge increase in energy, sleep 7-8 hours a day, don&#039;t feel the need to nap. I go out, even started jogging.""",9,18-May-12,93
64850,Sertraline,Depression,"""I began sertraline 50 mg approximately four weeks ago. I wasn%u2019t sure weather to take it at night or in the morning so I experimented with both. I found that during the day I would become very lethargic and yawn constantly with little energy but would then wake up in the middle of the night stimulated regardless of the time I took it. This frustrated me as I have always had a good sleep schedule and am an active person during the day, but I had read that others had experienced similar side effects and the effects eventually ceased. I felt better for several days%u2014not as downcast, brooding, heavy. 

After three weeks of taking it, the effect seemed to even out and I found myself struggling with feelings of hopelessness and doubt again. I felt better, certainly, just still struggling%u2014I don&#039;t expect a pill to %u201Ccure%u201D me of negative thoughts. I know I have control over my own thoughts, but it was that feeling of heaviness that tends to settle upon me%u2014like a dark cloud. When I went back to my doctor for the follow up, he increased it to 100 mg. I said let%u2019s try 75 mg first. He agreed. 

Within a couple weeks of taking 75 mg I still yawned a lot but I wasn%u2019t having trouble with lethargy and sleep issues as much. My attitude was much better. For example, I found that I really am a funny and silly person! I forgot that I was funny being under depression. I didn%u2019t realize how serious I had become, how reclusive. I also found my creativity really opened up. I had forgotten how creative I was. I also have been going to the gym and eating well. I try and smile and interact with people more%u2014even if I don%u2019t feel like it. I may just greet people or hold the door for them but it%u2019s better than me avoiding people like I used to. Some days are harder than others, but I can say that overall my experience with sertraline has been positive.""",8,13-May-15,24

I started taking Wellbutrin 2x a day with a plan to eventually increase to extended release but the meds kept me up all night. I got maybe 4 hours of sleep a night even with Zzzquil. My sleep was extremely restless and I woke up about every hour. I called my doctor and asked if I could switch to the extended release version but she said it would probably be the same situation.

After 2 weeks of this medication I couldnt stand anyone around me or even myself. I didnt want to be talked to or even looked at I felt depressed, life wasn&#039;t worth anything.

I still feel a little foggy sometimes but that is a small price to pay for my depression being pretty much completely gone.  I finally have energy and I am shocked at how quickly it worked.

Finally, we were able to find a Doctor who was familiar with head injuries and the low level of dopamine that the victim is often left with. Wellbutrin is a dopamine and noradrenaline re-uptake inhibitor so it is really working great for our son. It was literally like flicking his switch back &quot;on&quot;.

First week I felt very little change but that was actually a plus as many antidepressants I have tried have made me feel physically terrible and mentally kind of.. Sketchy? But with wellbutrin I only had minor headaches when smoking (not surprising considered its original use was as a cessation aid) and some very vivid dreams. 
At this point I am really starting to feel a change; random weeping down to once this past week rather than every damn day; starting to feel hopeful about the future again, showing more interest in my past hobbies, feeling grateful.

225020,Bupropion,Depression,"""Let me explain how I believe Wellbutrin works, based on my experience.  When you first take it, it first has to build up in your system over a week or so.  After just a few days, you get increased energy as norepinephrine and a little bit of dopamine are increased.  This continues for about a week to a week and a half, until your brain builds up a tolerance to the neurotransmitters by increasing the number of reuptake pumps for them.  So, then you feel lethargic for another week or a little more, until the reuptake pumps finally get either overwhelmed or desensitized by the constant flood of new neurotransmitters.  Then, quite suddenly and unexpectedly, you get hit with energy again.  The energy is not euphoric but quite steady.""",10,18-Jun-16,10

The only negative thing about this drug is that after a couple years, I notice that I have to go up a dosage because it seems less effective. I will notice my anxiety and depression more so than usual, but it is easily fixed with an increase. I started out at 50-100 mg, shortly being bumped up to 150 mg a day.

Sometimes euphoric mood, feel more outgoing, have increased libido, and feel very confident.
Negative side effects are hostility, being too assertive/pestering people/belaboring a point/arguing, going too far, some impulsive behavior.
I also get fearful of things I&#039;m not normally afraid of. Fear, not anxiety. Can&#039;t drive on the busy interstate now because I overreact when trucks pass me -- it jangles my nerves. Also can&#039;t go on rides at an amusement park or go up in a tall building. Physically afraid.
Also causes restless legs at night -- an urge to shake out my legs.

I used to take Citalopram which I just found made me worse, my mood was more irratic, I gained lots of weight and became suicidal. That is why my doctor changed the medication putting me on a 100mg of Sertraline. It has done me the world of good I would never go back.

I read that these side effects are pretty rare but they did include symptoms that were similar to flu.

I was just about to give up and felt like I was losing my mind when I was prescribed Wellburtrin XL 300mg only in the generic. I had taken it for two months and felt NOTHING. I was desperate. Then a friend who also uses it said to switch to the name brand. I kept reading how after 3 days you feel different, and I DID TOO! I hope this continues because I am feeling so much more relaxed and more like myself. I have stress, but it is not burying me and throwing me into panic. Listen, the generic does not work at all. You have to get the name brand! Hope this helps someone.""",8,13-Mar-15,51

My pulse was 115 and blood pressure was high (never ever is) it just shot up. The doctor said I was having a panic attack and that it is due to the medication.
